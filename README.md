Lomic is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) intended to be used for Pomic, a programming version of the game Nomic.

## Getting Started

    $ cd Lomic
    $ ruby parse.rb examples/simple.rb

Check out the `examples/` folder to see what Lomic is supposed to look like, and `parse.rb` to see how to use Lomic (in its current, underdeveloped state)
