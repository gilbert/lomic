# Lomic

Lomic is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) intended to be used for Pomic, a programming version of the game Nomic.

Due to the nature of programming and Nomic, Lomic should have these properties:

  * Event-driven
  * Linear Single-Threaded Priority-based Actor Model
  * Concise syntax geared towards simple game rule definitions

Lomic is currently in the concept stage. To discuss contributing, syntax, goals, or implementation, join us at #lomic on irc.freenode, or email me at gilbertbgarza aT gmail
