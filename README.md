# Lomic

Lomic is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) intended to be used for Pomic, a programming version of the game Nomic.

Due to the nature of programming and Nomic, Lomic should feel:

  * Event-driven
  * Finite State Machine oriented
  * Concise syntax geared towards simple game rule definitions

Lomic is currently in the concept and development stage. To discuss contributing, syntax, goals, or implementation, join us at #lomic on irc.freenode, or email me at gilbertbgarza aT gmail
